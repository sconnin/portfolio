Constructed an initial cross-sector analysis of 501c3 organizations in Vermont based on FORM 990 returns scraped from the internet. This work-in-progress supports comparative assessments of key financial indicators, organizational structure, projects, and contracts at a state level. Also included in the dataset are FORM 990EZ, FORM 990N, and Form 990PF.
