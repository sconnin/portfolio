Designed an interactive web-application for tracking diversity as a component of undergraduate attainment in STEM fields by institution, nationwide. The data are currently disaggregated at the level of student (racial category) and campus (academic sector, size, region, location). Updates are planned to incorporate data on gender and disciplinary field.

{{< figure src="/images/simpsons.jpg">}}

* Collected and transformed data for ~ 1800 public and private non-profit institutions in the USA over the period 2010-2020.
* Engineered metrics for racial diversity based on STEM completion totals.
* Modeled trends in diversity score by institution to facilitate cross-institution comparisons.
* Built a public-facing web-application using Dash, Plotly, and Heroku.
