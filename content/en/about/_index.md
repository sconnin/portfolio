A microscope and dissecting kit were my favorite Christmas gifts as a kid. I can and have built homes from foundation to roof despite my PhD. In a given crowd, I'm the high functioning introvert with a Bernese mountain dog. I wore overalls on the first date with my soon-to-become wife. She hasn't forgotten. 

I also have an affinity for statistical models & data viz, teamwork, strong coffee, Gibson archtops, and trilobites.
